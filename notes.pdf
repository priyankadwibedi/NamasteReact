Please Note: Write the answers and code on your own while finishing your assignments. Try to
put down your thoughts into words by yourself in your own words. (This will help you develop
muscle memory and you will remember all the concepts properly) ✌
# Theory Assignment:
● - What is `NPM`?
     npm is a package manager.
● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
     Parcel\Webpack is a bundler. We need it because it helps us to bundle everything and makes the app dev and prod ready.
● - What is `.parcel-cache`
     .parcel-cache is a folder that gets created when we run npx parcel index.html. It basically caches all the files that helps in HMR.
● - What is `npx` ?
       npx is a command that we use for the execution of any npm package.
● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
      dependencies are normal dependencies that can be used in development and production. But devDependencies can only be used during development 
      phase.
● - What is Tree Shaking?
● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
       .gitignore is a file basically where we can add the folders,or any files that git will ignore to not push to the remote repository.
            we can add the files that cannot be regenrated but we should avoid something that can be easily regenrated in the servers like .node_modules.
● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
        package.json is a file where it configures for our npm and we can see all versions of the dependencies. but in .package-lock.json it actually locks the versions of the dependencies.
● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
      it shouldnt be modified because it actually locks the dependencies that are needed in the application. And modifying it can break.
● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
       node_modules is like a database for our packages that our application needs. No, its not a good idea to push it to git.
● - What is the `dist` folder?
      dist folder gets generated once we build our app. It actually keeps the minified versions for all the files.
● - What is `browserlists`.
       browserlists is a dependency that we can add to our applicaiton where we can specify that upto which versions of browsers that our app can support. like
        browserlists:[last 2 versions]- this will run our app in all the browsers with the current version as well as the last 2 versions.
