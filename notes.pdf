Chapter 02 - Assignment - Igniting our App
Please Note: Write the answers and code on your own while finishing your assignments. Try to
put down your thoughts into words by yourself in your own words. (This will help you develop
muscle memory and you will remember all the concepts properly) ✌
# Theory Assignment:
● - What is `NPM`?
     npm is a package manager.
● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
     Parcel\Webpack is a bundler. We need it because it helps us to bundle everything and makes the app dev and prod ready.
● - What is `.parcel-cache`
     .parcel-cache is a folder that gets created when we run npx parcel index.html. It basically caches all the files that helps in HMR.
● - What is `npx` ?
       npx is a command that we use for the execution of any npm package.
● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
      dependencies are normal dependencies that can be used in development and production. But devDependencies can only be used during development 
      phase.
● - What is Tree Shaking?
● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
       .gitignore is a file basically where we can add the folders,or any files that git will ignore to not push to the remote repository.
            we can add the files that cannot be regenrated but we should avoid something that can be easily regenrated in the servers like .node_modules.
● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
        package.json is a file where it configures for our npm and we can see all versions of the dependencies. but in .package-lock.json it actually locks the versions of the dependencies.
● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
      it shouldnt be modified because it actually locks the dependencies that are needed in the application. And modifying it can break.
● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
       node_modules is like a database for our packages that our application needs. No, its not a good idea to push it to git.
● - What is the `dist` folder?
      dist folder gets generated once we build our app. It actually keeps the minified versions for all the files.
● - What is `browserlists`.
       browserlists is a dependency that we can add to our applicaiton where we can specify that upto which versions of browsers that our app can support. like
        browserlists:[last 2 versions]- this will run our app in all the browsers with the current version as well as the last 2 versions.

Episode -09
When and why do we need lazy()?
 we need lazy when we want to call a component on demand.That means it wont load that component if we make it lazy. And only load when we actually click on it and that means
 it does code splitting where it will create a separate js file under dist folder for that particular component.

● What is suspense?
   Suspense is a component which we wrap around the component which we want to make it lazy.

● Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to
synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator.
To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does
suspense fix this error?
   we got this error because react tries to render that component but since its not available at the time because of it being lazy it throws us this error

● Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?
    Advantages - If we have multiple components which itself have lot of subcomponents then if we dont do code splitting it will create only one js file once we do build which can lead to increase in that file size that can
    make app slow overtime. So code splitting helps with that

    disadvantages - It will create 
 
● When do we and why do we need suspense?
   we need suspense because it helps us to fallback to some jsx code until it renders that component.



   Chapter 08 - Let's get Classy
Theory Assignment:
● How do you create Nested Routes react-router-dom cofiguration
     
● Read abt createHashRouter, createMemoryRouter from React Router docs.

   
● What is the order of life cycle method calls in Class Based Components
    first the constructor is called
    second the render method gets called
    third componentDidMount gets called
    then componentDidUpdate gets called
    then componentWillUnmount gets called

● Why do we use componentDidMount?
   we use componentDidMount for API calls as it gets called once our render method gets called.

● Why do we use componentWillUnmount? Show with example
   we use componentWillUnmount when we no longer want that component to unmount. Lets say like for a cleanup 
   Its perfect to call clearIntervals functions in componentWillUnmount.

● (Research) Why do we use super(props) in constructor?
    we use super(props) because it gives us access to props to use in our component. if we dont use super(props) it will give us undefined
    Since we extend React.Component.

● (Research) Why can't we have the callback function of useEffect async?
   we cant use async in useEffect because async use promises which needs to be resolved or rejected and React doesnt understand that. If we want we can 
   create async function inside useEffect hook.
